			<h3 class="head">HISTORY OF W3C</h3>
			<p>In 1989, Sir <a href="tim berners.html" alter="Click here">Tim Berners-Lee</a> invented the World Wide Web (see the original proposal).He coined the term "World Wide Web," wrote the  first World Wide Web server, "httpd,"and the first client program (a browser and editor), "WorldWideWeb," in October 1990.</p>
		        <p>He wrote the first version of the "HyperText Markup Language" (HTML), the document formatting language with the capability for hypertext links that became the primary 
publishing format for the Web. His initial specification for URIs, HTTP, and HTML were refined and discussed in larger circles as Web technology spread.</p>
</div>
<div id="community" class="para">
			<h3 class="head">W3C Community</h3>
			<p>W3C's global standards constitute the toolkit for web solutions that scale, enabling innovators to solve hard problems, providing the proper foundations to meet requirements for accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security on the web.<br><br>
			<b>Standards that meet the varied needs of society are created not by one company but through the work of the Web Consortium community:</b><br>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Members:</b> More than 400 Members from around the world lead the development and implementation of standards.</li><br>
			<li><b>Staff:</b> W3C is a public-interest non-profit organization whose revenues come primarily from Membership dues. These and some grants support a staff of about 50 people.</li><br>
			<li><b>Developers:</b> Over 12,000 developers worldwide participate in the standards development.</li>
			</ul>

<div id="advantage">
		        <h3 class="para"><u>Some of our unique advantages</u></h3>
		        <ul class="f2">
		        <li><b>Open standards that make a difference:-</b><br><br>
		        Our community has developed several hundreds<br> of open standards that have enabled the creation<br> of two billion websites,the emergence of<br> flourishing business ecosystems, and made the Web<br> accessible to more people,inclusive and secure.</li>
                        <li><b>Royalty-free to boost adoption:-</b><br><br>
		        W3C standards may be used by<br> anyone at no cost: if they were<br> not free, developers would ignore them.</li>
		        </ul>
		        </div>
<div id="development" class="para">
		        <h3 class="head">W3C standard development process</h3>
		        <p>The proven standards development process upheld at the Web Consortium promotes fairness and enables progress.</p>
		        <p>Our standards work is accomplished in the open, under the W3C Process Document and royalty-free W3C Patent Policy,with input from the broader community. Decisions are taken by consensus. Technical direction and Recommendations require review by W3C Members â€“ large and small.</p>
		</div>
<div id="recognition" class="para">
		        <h3 class="head">Recognition</h3>
		        <p>In orchestrating these activities, the Web Consortium has earned a reputation for fairness, quality, and efficiency.</p>
		        <p>The Web Consortium's impact even extends beyond this planet: NASA regularly uses W3C standards in Mars and space exploration missions.</p>
		</div>
<div id="Organizational" class="para">
		        <h3 class="head">Organizational Structure</h3>
		        <p>In administrative terms W3C has become its own legal entity since January 2023, moving to a public-interest non-profit organization after 28 years with an atypical organizational structure where legal and fiduciary roles were assumed by four host institutions across the planet.Read more about the W3C history.</p>
